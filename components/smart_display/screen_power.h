// Saving power while the glass is dark (standby or Sleep at brightness 0). The backlight is already off then; this
// stops the two things that still run for nobody, and gives up nothing a lit screen needs:
//
// - drawing: LVGL pauses (ESPHome's own lvgl.pause), so nothing is rendered or sent to the panel. The model, the cards
//   and every change from Home Assistant keep being applied; LVGL draws the whole screen once when it resumes.
// - Wi-Fi: the radio dozes between the router's beacons (ESP-IDF's modem sleep, ESPHome's `light`). A lit screen keeps
//   the mode its YAML has, `none` from the core and from the YAML ESP Screens writes, so its messages never wait for a
//   beacon (firmware 0.2.74+); a dark one dozes, and gets its own mode back when it wakes. The connection stays up, so
//   Home Assistant still sees the screen and can wake it. ESPHome's high-performance request can't do this: it only
//   lets go of a `none` the YAML does not have, and every screen's YAML has it.
//
// rest() saves REST_MS after the screen went dark, once the backlight has faded out; leave() comes first in every
// wake, before the backlight comes up. A touch on the dark glass resumes drawing at once (touched()), so the touch
// reaches the wake overlay as it always did. SETTLE_MS after the finger lifted, once LVGL has had the release, a screen
// that is still dark had a tap LVGL did not see: one of TAP_MS or more wakes it, a shorter one is noise on the glass
// and the screen rests again. One wait does both (later) (core.yaml, screen_power_wait). Small on purpose: every byte counts on
// the 4 MB boards. Free of LVGL and ESPHome; core.yaml hands it the hooks at boot.
