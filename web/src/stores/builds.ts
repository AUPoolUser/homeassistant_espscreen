// ---- Builds: one source for "something is building" ----
// The add-on builds one firmware at a time, and everything that builds waits its turn in its one build line
// (build_queue.py, docs/BUILDS.md): updates, plugin builds, New screen, Firmware & USB and the YAML check. Every live
// answer of the add-on (the inventory, pushed whenever the line changes) holds the line itself (`line`: every build by
// its id, what runs, what waits and the last ones that ended with their outcome) and, from the same look at it, what is
// built for each screen now (`builds`, Manager.builds). That one answer is the one source; the firmware answer
// (api/firmware), asked only while something builds, adds ESPHome's log of the build that runs. Every part of the page
// that shows a build reads it here: the screen list, the Plugins entry and tab,
// the settings' Updates card, the build log, New screen, Firmware & USB and the YAML check (useLineBuild follows one).
// `updating` holds the screens the page just asked to update, for the moment until the add-on's builds name them.
// Updates start here too (one screen, all of them, automatic), and so does every other build the page asks for
// (askBuild), and the add-on's firmware job is asked for here, once for whoever follows it.
